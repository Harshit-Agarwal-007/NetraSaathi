# NetraSaathi
Visually impaired individuals struggle with navigating unfamiliar spaces, feeling unsafe and hesitant to step outside. Traditional tools like walking sticks offer limited help. Our project, NetraSathi, aims to develop an AI-powered device that provides real-time audio feedback to help them navigate confidently and safely.
