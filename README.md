Visually impaired individuals face significant challenges in navigating their surroundings, especially in unfamiliar and dark environments. Despite using tools like the traditional walking stick, many still struggle with safety, independence, and confidence while traveling in public spaces. According to research, 70% of blind individuals are afraid to step out of their homes because they do not feel safe navigating unknown places.

The existing tools and technologies are often insufficient in providing real-time assistance, especially for navigating obstacles, estimating distances, or identifying the direction of movement. This lack of support significantly impacts their daily lives and limits their independence.

To address these challenges, we aim to develop an innovative solution that offers real-time feedback and assistance for the visually impaired, enabling them to navigate with confidence and safety.
